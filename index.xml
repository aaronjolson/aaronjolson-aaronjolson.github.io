      <description>Recently I purchased an Acer gaming laptop loaded with Windows 10. I was really attracted to the quality of the hardware vs the price. The hard part would be moving off of the Unix type environment I&amp;rsquo;ve been used to. Adjusting to Windows took a little tweaking on my part.
