Youtube playlists &amp;amp; tutorials thenewboston thenewboston has a very entertaining and well done Python basics tutorial playlist. If you are brand new to programming and/or Python I would recommend starting here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBxCHonP6Ro&amp;amp;list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_
